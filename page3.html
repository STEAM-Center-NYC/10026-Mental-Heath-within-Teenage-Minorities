      <img style="float: right;" src="https://www.nami.org/getmedia/c66a7e9f-c0f4-4715-a8c2-f62c9a604518/challenge-ORIG_1?width=500&height=321" alt="mental logo2" height="350px" width="400px">
      <p> African Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, Asians and Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics.
        These groups are most commonly known as minority groups. Minority, a culturally, ethnically, or racially
        distinct group that coexists with but is subordinate to a more dominant group. As the term is used in the
        social sciences, this subordinacy is the chief defining characteristic of a minority group.

      <h2>Ways to identify Mental Illness</h2>
      <ul><li>Long-lasting sadness or irritability</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Extremely high and low moods</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Excessive fear, worry, or anxiety</li></ul>
      <ul><li> Social withdrawal</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Dramatic changes in eating or sleeping habits</li></ul>
      <br>
    <p>One out of seven kids  in the age range of 10-19 experience some level of mental illness. During this age range
      adolescents are more vulnerable to change due to their surroundings. This can be caused by poverty, abuse, and violence. 
      Adolescence is a crucial period for developing social and emotional habits important for mental well-being. These include
      adopting healthy sleep patterns; exercising regularly; developing coping, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills; and learning
      to manage emotions. Protective and supportive environments in the family, at school and in the wider community are important.
    </p>
    <p>Multiple factors affect mental health. The more risk factors adolescents are exposed to, the greater the potential impact on their mental health. Factors that can contribute to stress during adolescence include exposure to adversity, pressure to conform with peers and exploration of identity. Media influence and gender norms can exacerbate the disparity between an adolescentâ€™s lived reality and their perceptions or aspirations for the future. Other important determinants include the quality of their home life and relationships with peers. Violence (especially sexual violence and bullying), harsh parenting and severe and socioeconomic problems are recognized risks to mental health.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Some adolescents are at greater risk of mental health conditions due to their living conditions, stigma, discrimination or exclusion, or lack of access to quality support and services. These include adolescents living in humanitarian and fragile settings; adolescents with chronic illness, autism spectrum disorder, an intellectual disability or other neurological condition; pregnant adolescents, adolescent parents, or those in early or forced marriages; orphans; and adolescents from minority ethnic or sexual backgrounds or other discriminated groups.
